### PROJ

Because so much open source (and other) software uses the PROJ library and framework, many are affected when PROJ upgrades. Until very recently, PROJ has been seen as very reliable, and the changes taking place now are intended to confirm and reinforce this reliability. Before PROJ 5 (PROJ 6 is out now, PROJ 7 is coming early in 2020), the `+datum=` tag was used, perhaps with `+towgs84=` with three or seven coefficients, and possibly `+nadgrids=` where datum transformation grids were available. However, transformations from one projection to another first inversed to longitude-latitude in WGS84, then projected on to the target projection.


### Big bump coming:

'Fast-forward 35 years and PROJ.4 is everywhere: It provides coordinate handling for almost every geospatial program, open or closed source. Today,  we  see  a  drastical  increase  in  the  need  for  high  accuracy  GNSS  coordinate  handling, especially in the agricultural and construction engineering sectors.  This need for geodetic-accuracy transformations  is  not  satisfied  by  "classic  PROJ.4".  But  with  the  ubiquity  of  PROJ.4,  we  can provide these transformations "everywhere", just by implementing them as part of PROJ.4' [@evers+knudsen17].


### Escaping the WGS84 hub/pivot: PROJ and OGC WKT2


Following the introduction of geodetic modules and pipelines in PROJ 5 [@knudsen+evers17; @evers+knudsen17], PROJ 6 moves further. Changes in the legacy PROJ representation and WGS84 transformation hub have been coordinated through the [GDAL barn raising](https://gdalbarn.com/) initiative. Crucially WGS84 often ceases to be the pivot for moving between datums. A new OGC WKT is coming, and an SQLite EPSG file database has replaced CSV files. SRS will begin to support 3D by default, adding time too as SRS change. See also [PROJ migration notes](https://proj.org/development/migration.html).

There are very useful postings on the PROJ mailing list from Martin Desruisseaux, first [proposing clarifications](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2019-July/008748.html) and a [follow-up](https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2019-August/008750.html) including a summary:

> * "Early binding" ≈ hub transformation technique.

> * "Late binding" ≈ hub transformation technique NOT used, replaced by
a more complex technique consisting in searching parameters in the
EPSG database after the transformation context (source, target,
epoch, area of interest) is known.

> * The problem of hub transformation technique is independent of WGS84.
It is caused by the fact that transformations to/from the hub are
approximate. Any other hub we could invent in replacement of WGS84
will have the same problem, unless we can invent a hub for which
transformations are exact (I think that if such hub existed, we
would have already heard about it).

> The solution proposed by ISO 19111 (in my understanding) is:

> * Forget about hub (WGS84 or other), unless the simplicity of
early-binding is considered more important than accuracy.

> * Associating a CRS to a coordinate set (geometry or raster) is no
longer sufficient. A {CRS, epoch} tuple must be associated. ISO
19111 calls this tuple "Coordinate metadata". From a programmatic
API point of view, this means that getCoordinateReferenceSystem()
method in Geometry objects (for instance) needs to be replaced by a
getCoordinateMetadata() method.


In QGIS built on current PROJ 6 with the `proj.h` API (and GDAL built on current PROJ 6 with the `proj.h` API), we see the following sequence of GUI windows when trying to open the olinda.gpkg file.


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/A_Screenshot.png')
```

Instead of using the declared coordinate reference system of the added layer to provide a transformation/conversion relationship to possible WGS84 geographical coordinate or web mapping backgrounds, the user of the most recent QGIS version with PROJ 6 faces a choice of three alternatives with varying availabilities and precisions:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/B_Screenshot.png')
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/C_Screenshot.png')
```

The third alternative has better precision, but depends on finding and installing an NTv2 grid file in the PROJ `shared/proj` metadata folder:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/D_Screenshot.png')
```

If we install the file, the choices change to promote the more precise NTv2-based path to the first position:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('images/E_Screenshot.png')
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
packageVersion("sf")
```

The final element reported by `sf::sf_extSoftVersion()` shows whether **sf** was built with the `proj.h` interface to PROJ, or the legacy `proj.api.h` interface. However, GDAL also has to be built with the `proj.h` interface for everything to line up:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
sf_extSoftVersion()
```



```{r, echo=TRUE}
st_crs(22525)
```

The OGC WTK2 definition now contains a usage/scope term showing where the definition may be used; there may also be a temporal frame for a definition.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cat(system("projinfo EPSG:22525", intern=TRUE), sep="\n")
```

If we ask about possible transformations/conversions, we see choices we saw among those represented in QGIS (I work on two apparently identical systems, which may give different choice counts)

```{r, echo=TRUE}
cat(system("projinfo -s EPSG:22525 -t EPSG:31985", intern=TRUE), sep="\n")
```

The input data use the Corrego Alegre 1970-1972 setting, and still provide a `+towgs84=` key representation for pivoting through WGS84:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
olinda <- st_read("data/olinda.gpkg", quiet=TRUE)
st_crs(olinda)
```

We'll just use one point to check things out:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
xy_c <- st_centroid(st_geometry(olinda[  1,]))
st_coordinates(xy_c)
```

If we manually pivot through WGS84 on the way back to SIRGAS2000 UTM, we get:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
st_coordinates(st_transform(st_transform(xy_c, 4326), 31985))
```

Without the NTv2 grid file `CA7072_003.gsb` we seem to get the same:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# without CA7072_003.gsb
st_coordinates(st_transform(xy_c, 31985))
```

but we also get the same with the grid file if we leave the `+towgs84=` key in the PROJ string:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# with CA7072_003.gsb
st_coordinates(st_transform(xy_c, 31985))
#          X       Y
# 1 295489.3 9120352
```

If however we manipulate the PROJ string to specify the grid file instead of the `+towgs84=` key, we can get the improved precision:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# with CA7072_003.gsb
xy_c1 <- xy_c
st_crs(xy_c1) <- "+proj=utm +zone=25 +south +ellps=intl +units=m +nadgrids=CA7072_003.gsb"
print(st_coordinates(st_transform(xy_c1, 31985)), digits=9)
#            X          Y
# 1 295486.396 9120350.62
```

Let's try to use the PROJ utility program `cs2cs` in its PROJ 6 version. The `cs2cs` version when the grid file is present matches `sf::st_transform()` when the input CRS is modified to point to the grid file:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# with CA7072_003.gsb
cat(system(paste0("echo ", paste(xy, collapse=" "), " | cs2cs EPSG:22525 EPSG:31985"), intern=TRUE))
# 295486.40 9120350.62 0.00
```

`cs2cs` without the grid file gives:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
xy <- st_coordinates(xy_c)
# without CA7072_003.gsb
cat(system(paste0("echo ", paste(xy, collapse=" "), " | cs2cs EPSG:22525 EPSG:31985"), intern=TRUE))
```

This matches the second set of `+towgs84=` coefficients:

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# without CA7072_003.gsb
xy_c2 <- xy_c
st_crs(xy_c2) <- "+proj=utm +zone=25 +south +ellps=intl +units=m +towgs84=-206.05,168.28,-3.82,0,0,0,0"
st_coordinates(st_transform(xy_c2, 31985))
```

Using the `lwgeom::st_transform_proj()` for now uses the `proh_api.h` interface:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# without CA7072_003.gsb
# -DACCEPT_USE_OF_DEPRECATED_PROJ_API_H
st_coordinates(lwgeom::st_transform_proj(xy_c, 31985))
```

Our reprojected objects in SIRGAS2000 used the WGS84 pivot with one of two possible sets of `+towgs84=` coefficients:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
olinda <- st_read("output/olinda_sirgas2000.gpkg", quiet=TRUE)
xy_c <- st_centroid(st_geometry(olinda[  1,]))
st_coordinates(xy_c)
```
