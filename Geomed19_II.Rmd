## Session II

- 11:10-11:40 (20+10) Ongoing changes in external sofware (GEOS, GDAL), including software and standards used for representing spatial reference systems (PROJ)

- 11:40-12:10 (20+10) GIS bridges (description and using GRASS and **rgrass7**)

- 12:10-12:50 (20+20) Using R as a GIS (topological operations)


Internal (R) and system dependencies look like this:
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('sf_deps.png')
```
