## Session II

- 11:10-11:40 (20+10) Coordinate metadata (PROJ)

- 11:40-12:10 (20+10) GIS bridges (description and using GRASS)

- 12:10-12:50 (20+20) Using R as a GIS (topological operations)

GIS and R: bridges or R as GIS? The second session will present general principles of GIS in R - R as GIS is becoming more feasible as new contributed packages appear, and/or R bridges to GIS to permit GIS operations to be done in GIS but statistical operations in R.
