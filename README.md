## GEOMED workshop, Geomed 2019, Glasgow, 27 August

### Representation and visualisation of spatial data

Workshop goal: to provide enough understanding of how spatial data is (and will be) represented in R

Please download the HTML workshop document () and the script & data zipfile. The software required is stated at the head of the HTML document, in sesssion I current R packages, in session II current R packages and GRASS GIS 7.6.1 (https://grass.osgeo.org/download/software) if you wish to explore this R-GIS bridge as an example and do not have GRASS installed.

09:00-10:40 The representation of spatial and spatio-temporal data is important to its handling and preparation for analysis. While the **sp** package has provided legacy representations still used by many, the **sf** package introduces more modern spatial vector representations, and the **stars** package is moving towards a similar modernisation of raster array representations. As yet no replacement for the **spacetime** package has been proposed, although **stars** does reach out towards spatio-temporal data. The session will conclude by presenting ongoing improvements in thematic maps in the **tmap** and **cartography** packages, and interactive mapping in **mapview**.

11:10-12:50 GIS and R: bridges or R as GIS? The second session starts by describing ongoing changes in external sofware, including software and standards used for representing spatial reference systems. The session will continue by presenting general principles of GIS in R - R as GIS is becoming more feasible as new contributed packages appear, and/or R bridges to GIS to permit GIS operations to be done in GIS but statistical operations in R.
