## GEOMED workshop abstract

### Representation and visualisation of spatial and spatio-temporal data

Workshop goal: to provide enough understanding of how spatial (and maybe spatio-temporal) data is (and will be) represented in R

09:00-10:40 The representation of spatial and spatio-temporal data is important to its handling and preparation for analysis. While the **sp** package has provided legacy representations still used by many, the **sf** package introduces more modern spatial vector representations, and the **stars** package is moving towards a similar modernisation of raster array representations. As yet no replacement for the **spacetime** package has been proposed, although **stars** does reach out towards spatio-temporal data. The first session will also describe ongoing changes in external sofware used for representing spatial reference systems. 

11:10-12:50 GIS and R: bridges or R as GIS? The second session will present general principles of GIS in R - R as GIS is becoming more feasible as new contributed packages appear, and/or R bridges to GIS to permit GIS operations to be done in GIS but statistical operations in R. The seesion will conclude by presenting ongoing improvements in thematic maps in the **tmap** and **cartography** packages, and interactive mapping in **mapview**.
