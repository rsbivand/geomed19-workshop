abstract="Functions to calculate measures of spatial association, especially measures of spatial autocorrelation, have been made available in many software applications. Measures may be global, applying to the whole data set under consideration, or local, applying to each observation in the data set. Methods of statistical inference may also be provided, but these will, like the measures themselves, depend on the support of the observations, chosen assumptions, and the way in which spatial association is represented; spatial weights are often used as a representational technique. In addition, assumptions may be made about the underlying mean model, and about error distributions. Different software implementations may choose to expose these choices to the analyst, but the sets of choices available may vary between these implementations, as may default settings. This comparison will consider the implementations of global Moran's I, Getis--Ord G and Geary's C, local {\$}{\$}I{\_}i{\$}{\$}Iiand {\$}{\$}G{\_}i{\$}{\$}Gi, available in a range of software including Crimestat, GeoDa, ArcGIS, PySAL and R contributed packages.",

abstract = "A new estimation method for spatial binary probit models is presented. Both spatial auto-regressive (SAR) and spatial error (SEM) models are considered. The proposed estimator relies on the approximation of the likelihood function, that follows a multivariate normal distribution which parameters depend on the spatial structure of the observations. The approximation is inspired by the univariate conditioning procedure proposed by Mendell and Elston, with some modifications to improve accuracy and speed. Very accurate parameter estimations have been achieved in reasonable time for simulated data samples with as much as one million observations. The lessons learned in the Monte Carlo experiment have been applied to a case study on urban sprawl over more than forty thousands plots in Southern France."

abstract = "Maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of simultaneous autocorrelation models is well known. Under the presence of missing data, estimation is not straightforward, due to the implied dependence of all units. The EM algorithm is the standard approach to accomplish ML estimation in this case. An alternative approach is considered, the method of maximising the marginal likelihood. At first glance the method is computationally complex due to inversion of large matrices that are of the same size as the complete data, but these can be avoided, leading to an algorithm that is usually much faster than the EM algorithm and without typical EM convergence issues. Another approximate method is also proposed that serves as an alternative, for example when the contiguity matrix is dense. The methods are illustrated using a well known data set on house prices with 25,357 units."

Abstract = {{Spatial estimators usually require the manipulation of n(2) relations
   among n observations and use operations such as determinants,
   eigenvalues, and inverses whose operation counts grow at a rate
   proportional to n(3). This paper provides ways to quickly compute
   estimates when the dependent variable follows a spatial autoregressive
   process, which by appropriate specification of the independent
   variables can subsume the case when the errors follow a spatial
   autoregressive process. Since only nearby observations fend to affect a
   given observation, most observations have no effect and hence the
   spatial weight matrix becomes sparse. By exploiting sparsity and
   rearranging computations, one can compute estimates at low cost. As a
   demonstration of the efficacy of these techniques, the paper provides a
   Monte Carlo study whereby 3,107 observation regressions require only
   0.1 seconds each when using Matlab on a 200 Mhz Pentium Pro personal
   computer. In addition, the paper illustrates these techniques by
   examining voting behavior across U.S. counties in the 1980 presidential

Abstract = {{Spatial estimators usually provide lower prediction errors than their

   a large number of operations. Fortunately, for a given observation only
   a relatively small number of nearby observations typically exhibit
   correlated errors. This means that most of the elements of the n by n
   spatial matrices are zero. The use of sparse matrix techniques can
   dramatically lower storage requirements and reduce execution times. In
   addition, adopting a first differencing model allows the use of GLS
   which avoids the necessity of evaluating an n by n determinant. This
   also greatly reduces computational costs.}},
